# JS Fundamentals Functional

_Looping and destructuring_

1.- Loop through an array of objects (could be the same from the previous exercise)

2.- Loop through all the properties of the suspect objects in the suspects array, mark them if you think they are guilty.

3.- Destructure this nested data structure into two variables with the strings 'red' and 'orange'.
````
 suspects: [
    { name: 'Rusty', color: 'Orange' },
    { name: 'Miss Scarlett', color: 'Red' },
  ];
````
