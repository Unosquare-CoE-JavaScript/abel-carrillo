# Angular 1.x Essentials

_Abel Carrillo_

* Declare your module
* Declare your controller
* Set properties and scope object

### Yeoman
### Grunt

## $compile
compiles DOM into a template function that can then be used
to lonk scope and the view together

## $digest
Processes all of the watchers of the current scope

## $apply
Is used to notify that something has happened outside of the
AngularJS domain

## $apply
Forces a $digest cycle

## MVVM
Model View, View Model

## Controller and scope
* $scope is the glue between the Controller and the View
* The Controller is responsible for constructing the model
on $scope and providing commands for the View to act upon
$scope provides context

## Controllers should...
* Not know anything about the view they control
* Be small and focused
* Not talk to other controllers
* Not own the domain model

## _The view is angular js compiled DOM, the view is the
product of $compile merging the HTML template with $scope,
DOM is no longer the single source of truth_

## Model and services
* Services carry out common tasks specific to the web,
* Services are consumed via the AngularJS Dependency
Injection subsystem
* Are app singletons
* Are instantiated lazily

## Routes
$route is used for deep linking URLs to Controllers
and define routes using $routeProvider.
Typically used un conjunction with ngView directive and
$routeParams service

## Directives
* Directives are a DSL
* DDO (Directive Definition Object), tells the compiler how a directive is
supposed to be assembled, common properties are the **link** function,
**controller** function, **restrict, template** and **templateUrl**

## The Controller Function
Is constructed during the pre-linking phase, receives $scope which is 
the current scope for the element

## The link function
Is where DOM manipulation happens, comes with **scope.
**attrs** is a list of atributes declared on the element.

## Server side integration
* REST anf $HTTP
* Promises
* Real time communication

## Promises
Returned value of calling $http is a promise.
You can use the **then** method to register callbacks.
These callbacks receive a single argument - an object
representing the response.

## E2E testing with angularJS
* The environment
* Unit testing
* E2E testing

## Matchers

> expect(a).toBe(b);

> expect(a).not.toBe(null);

## Spies
* spyOn(mockUserService, 'userExists').andCallThrough();
* scope.userExists();
* expect(mockUserService.userExists).toHaveBeenCalled();

## Isolated scope
Prevents your direcive from accidentally modifying data in the parent scope.
This in a sense defines the API for the directive

## Expression isolated scope
* Defined using an & symbol
* Allows you to execute an expression on the parent scope
* To pass variables from child to parent expressions you must use an object
