# TypeScript

_Abel Carrillo_

Is a JS superset, adds new features and advantages to JS, code compiled to JS.
* Types
* Extra error checking
* Right and cleaner code
* Features like Interfaces or Generics
* Meta-programing features like Decorators

## Tuple
Fixed-length array

## Enums
Automatically enumerated global constant identifiers

## Custom types

````JavaScript
type User = { name: string; age: number };
const u1: User = { name: 'Max', age: 30 }; // this works!

````

## Watch mode
> tsc --init

> tsc -w

## tsconfig.json recommendations
Helps us with debugging and development

> set the "sourceMap": true option in tsconfig.json

### rootDir and outDir
> rootDir: ./src

> outDir: ./dist

Smaller files ignoring comments on .js:
> removeComments: true

Check .ts without generate the .js files
> noEmit: true

### Code quality optoions

Strict compilation
> strict: true 

No unused locals: show us a warning when we declare a variable
but never use it (only in functions)
> noUnusedLocals: true

>noUnusedParameters

>noImplicitReturns

## Classes
OOP
Work with real entities: Shop program
* ProductList
* Product
* ShoppingCart

Classes help us with that:

Objects: the things you work with in code, instances of classes

Classes: Blueprints for objects, define how objects look like,
wich properties and methods they have


## this keyword
Access all the properties and methods of the actual instance

## Static properties and methods
Access to them without instanciate.

## Abstract class
A class that can't be instantiated but has to be extended

## Singleton pattern
Ensuring that you only have one instance of a certain class
* Private constructor (only accessible inside the class)

## Interface
Describes the structure of an object, we can use it as a type to type
check for objects that must have X structure.

Interfaces can't be instantiated and are not compiled, classes can be instantiated and are compiled

## Advanced types
* Intersection types: allows us to
* Type guards
* Discriminated unions
* Type casting
* Function overloads

## Generics
* Generic functions and classes
* Cosntraints
* Special TS types

## Decorators
Can be added more than one to a class.
A decorator is a function that executes when your class is defined

## Template tags
> <template id="">
HTML code that doesn't loaded immediately, its rendered when we want

## Code into multiple files
* Namespace & File Bundling
* ES6 Imports/Exports

## namespace Imports

## Webpack
* Code bundles, less imports required
* Oprtimized (minified) code, less code to download
* More build steps can be added easily


## Axios (HTTP requests)

## View encapsulation

````JavaScript
@Component({
    selector: "app-server-element",
    templateUrl: "./server-element.component.html",
    styleUrls: ["./server-element.component.css"],
    encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None // <==== (css gobally aplied)
})

````

## Component Lyfecycle
* ngOnChanges: Called after a bound input property changes
* ngOnInit: Called once the component is initialized, will run after the `constructor`
* ngDoCheck: Called during every change detection run
* ngAfterContentInit: Called after content (ng-content) has been projected into view
* ngAfterContentChecked: Called every time the projected content has been checked
* ngAfterViewInit: Called after the component's view (and child views) has been initialized
* ngAfterViewChecked: Called every time the view (and child views) have been checked
* ngOnDestroy: Called once the component is about to be destroyed
