# Angular2021

_Abel Carrillo_

Catch all paths app doesn't know and redirect, should be
the last one in your array of routes:

> { path: '**', redirectTo: 'not-found', pathMatch: 'full'}


## Observables
An error cancels the Observable, it doesn't complete it
Every Observable has a pipe method

## Forms
Template-Driven: Angular infers the Form Object
from the DOM

Reactive: Form is created programatically and
synchronized with the DOM


## tsconfig.json recommendations
Helps us with debugging and development

> set the "sourceMap": true option in tsconfig.json

### rootDir and outDir
> rootDir: ./src

> outDir: ./dist

Smaller files ignoring comments on .js:
> removeComments: true

Check .ts without generate the .js files
> noEmit: true

### Code quality options

Strict compilation
> strict: true 

No unused locals: show us a warning when we declare a variable
but never use it (only in functions)
> noUnusedLocals: true

>noUnusedParameters

>noImplicitReturns

## Classes
OOP
Classes help us to work with real entities: Shop program
* ProductList
* Product
* ShoppingCart

Objects: the things you work with in code, instances of classes.

Classes: Blueprints for objects, define how objects look like,
wich properties and methods they have


## this keyword
Access all the properties and methods of the actual instance.

## Static properties and methods
Access to them without instanciate.

## Abstract class
A class that can't be instantiated but has to be extended

## Singleton pattern
Ensuring that you only have one instance of a certain class
* Private constructor (only accessible inside the class)

## Interface
Describes the structure of an object, we can use it as a type to type
check for objects that must have X structure.

Interfaces can't be instantiated and are not compiled, classes can be instantiated and are compiled

## Advanced types
* Intersection types: allows us to
* Type guards
* Discriminated unions
* Type casting
* Function overloads

## Generics
* Generic functions and classes
* Cosntraints
* Special TS types

## Decorators
Can be added more than one to a class.
A decorator is a function that executes when your class is defined

Decorator alias:
> @Input('name') productName: string  // 'name' = alias
> @ViewChild('nForm') newForm: NgForm;

## Template tags
> <template id="">
HTML code that doesn't loaded immediately, its rendered when we want

## Code into multiple files
* Namespace & File Bundling
* ES6 Imports/Exports

## namespace Imports

## Webpack
* Code bundles, less imports required
* Oprtimized (minified) code, less code to download
* More build steps can be added easily


## Axios (HTTP requests)

## View encapsulation

````TypeScript
@Component({
    selector: "app-server-element",
    templateUrl: "./server-element.component.html",
    styleUrls: ["./server-element.component.css"],
    encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None // <==== (css gobally aplied)
})

````

## Component Lyfecycle
* ngOnChanges: Called after a bound input property changes
* ngOnInit: Called once the component is initialized, will run after the `constructor`
* ngDoCheck: Called during every change detection run
* ngAfterContentInit: Called after content (ng-content) has been projected into view
* ngAfterContentChecked: Called every time the projected content has been checked
* ngAfterViewInit: Called after the component's view (and child views) has been initialized
* ngAfterViewChecked: Called every time the view (and child views) have been checked
* ngOnDestroy: Called once the component is about to be destroyed


## Modules recommendations

### For services: 
Provide them application-wide to keep
the app module cleaner and leaner:

````TypeScript
@Injectable({ provideIn: 'root' })
export class UserService {}

````
If you provide a service in the app module and in the 
lazy loaded module, then the service is available app-wide BUT the lazy 
loaded module will get a separate
instance.

Generally you want to ensure that services are always
available app-wide by using @Injectable({providedIn: 'root'}) unless you have 
a strong reason for adding them only in a component tree

## Ahead-of-Time (AoT) vs Just-in-Time (JiT) Compilation

AoT Compiler: Used to deploy our app to production (--prod), optimizes our code

JiT Compiler: Is more forgiving than AoT

## Application State

Theoretically, it is the entire memory of the application, but, typically, 
it is the data received via API calls, user inputs, presentation UI State, app preferences, etc. 
Simply put, it is the data that can differentiate two instances of the same application. 
A simple concrete example of an application state would be a list of customers maintained in an application.

For simplicity, let's assume we have a list of customers in the application, and that is 
the state that we are trying to manage. Some API calls and user inputs could change the 
state ( i.e. the list ) by adding or removing customers

## NgRx

Angular's implementation of Redux.

Redux: Library/pattern to manage

## Angular Universal
 Allows us to pre render out angular app on the server.

## Angular Schematics

Custom "ng generate" schematics
Example: 
* Will create a navigation component from angular material:
 ng g @angular/material: nav main-nav


## Angular Elements

Feature to turn normal angular components into native web components.
Can be used by angular projects and non angular projects.
For non angular app: exporting a JS file, this file could be imported as a script.

### Some commands:

ng lint: _check code quality_
ng update @anglar/core @angular/cli
