# Deep JS

_Abel Carrillo_

### Course overview
Types
* Primitive types
* Abstract operations
* Coercion
* Equality
* TypeScript, flow, etc

Scope
* Nested scope
* Hoisting
* Closure
* Modules

Objects
* this
* class {}
* Prototypes
* OO vs. OLOO

### typeof
Returns a string with the type

_Note: arrays are subtypes of object_

### BigInts
> var v = 22n;

### Kinds of emptiness
* undefined
* undeclared
* uninitialized (TDZ, temporal dead zone, ES6)

### Special values
* NaN (invalid number)
to check: isNaN(variable)

### Infinity
Represents th econcept of an infinite number

### Fundamental objects
 Dont use new keyword:
 * String()
 * Number()
 * Boolean()

 ### Coercion
 Turn into a number
 > +string

 >Number(string) 

 ### Comments on code
 Should say why, not what

 ### Double and triple equals
 You should prefer double equals in all possible cases (when you know the types).
 If types are the same, == is identical to ===
 If you dont know the types, the most obvious signal is ===

 ### Scope
 _Global, functions and blocks_

 If we cannot find a variable that is referenced within the scope, we go up one level.

````JavaScript
var tecaher = 'Kyle';

function otherClass() {
    var teacher = 'Susy';
    console.log('Welcome');
}

function ask() {
    var question = 'Why?';
    console.log(question);
}

otherClass(); // Welcome
ask(); // Why?

````
First pass compilation:
The compiler and the scope manager

Second pass execution

_Always declare the variables that you want to use declare them in whatever scope you need them, but don't auto create them like this:_

````JavaScript
var tecaher = 'Kyle';

function otherClass() {
     teacher = 'Susy';
     topic = 'React';
    console.log('Welcome');
}
````

TypeError: when you found the variable and the value is not legal to do whatever you're trying to do with it.

ReferenceError: It couldn't find that variable 
###  Function expression & function declaration

````JavaScript
function tecaher() {} // f.declaration

var myTeacher = function anotherTeacher() { // f.expression
     teacher = 'Susy';
     topic = 'React';
    console.log('Welcome');
}
````

_You should prefer the named function expression over the anonymous function expression_

The principle of least exposure or privilege:
_You should default to keeping everything private, and only exposing the minimal necessary_

_Brendan Eich_ the creator of the JavaScript language

### Closure
Is when a function "remembers" its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that lexical scope.

Is A preservation of the linkage to a variable, not the capturing of the value.

### Modules
A module pattern requires the concept of encapsulation

_Javascript is a delegation/prototype system, not a class system_


_Again, the only reasonable explanation is that the code mustfirst befullyparsed before any execution occurs._
