# Design Patterns in JS

_Abel Carrillo_

## The Patterns
* Creational
* Structural
* Behavioral 

_JS isn't properly OOP, but it's close enough for all purposes_

_JS desn't really have interfaces_

## ISP - Interface Segregation Principle
You have to segregate or split up interfaces

## Factory
* Factory method: is a static method that creates objects.
* Factory: is any entity that can take care of object creation

## Prototype Design Pattern
* To implement a prototype, partially construct an 
object and store it somewhere
* Deep copy the prototype
* Customize the resulting instance
* A factory provides a convenient PAI for using prototypes

## Singleton implementation

Singleton: a component wich is instanciated only once.

## Adapter
A construct wich adapts an existing interface X to
conform to the required interface Y.

## Bridge
* Decouple abstraction from implementation
* Both can exist as hierarchies
* Stronger form of encapsulation

## Composite
* Objects can use other objects via inheritance/composition
* Some composed and singular objects need similar/identical behaviors
* JS supports iteration with Symbol.iterator
* A single object can make itself

## Decorator
* Facilitates the addition of behaviors to individual
object without inheriting from them
* It's a class that takes a reference to whatever object you're decorating in the constructor.

## Facade
* Build Facade to provide a simplified PAI over a set of classes

## Flyweight
* Store common data externally

## Proxy
* To create a proxy, simply replicate the existing interface of an object
* Add relevant functionality to the redefined member functions

## Chain of responsibility
* Can be implemented as a chain of references or a centralized construct
* Enlist objects in the chain, possibly controlling their order/priority

## Command
* Encapsulate all details of an operation in a separate object
* Define instruction for applying th e command (either the command itself, or elsewhere)
* Optionally define instructions for undoing the command
* Can create composite commands (a.k.a macros)

## Interpreter
* A component that processes structured text data

## Iterator
* An iterator specified how you can traverse an object
* Stateful iterator cannot be recursive
* yiel allows for much more succinct iteration

## Mediator
* Create the mediator and have each object in the system
refer to it
* Mediator engages in bidirectional communication wich
its connected components
* Has functions the components can call
* Components have funcions the mediator can call

## Memento
* Mementos are used to roll back states arbitrarily
* Is a token/handle class with (typically) no functions of its own
* Can be used to implement undo/redo

## Observer
* Is an intrusive approach: an observable must provide
an event to subscribe to
* Subscription and unsubscription handled with addition/removal
of items in a list

## Strategy
* Define an algorithm at high level
* Define the interface you expect each strategy to follow
* Provide for dynamic composition of strategies in the resulting object

## Template method
* Define an algorithm at high level
* Define constituent parts as empty methods/properties
* Inherit the algorithm class, providing necessary overrides

## Visitor
* Propagate an accept (visitor v) method throughout th entire hierarchy
* Create a visitor with visitFoo(Foo), visitBar(Bar), ... for 
each element in the hierarchy
