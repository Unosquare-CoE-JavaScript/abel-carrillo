# Javascript Notes
_Abel Carrillo_

### Three main pillars of Javascript
* The type and coercion system
* Scope and closure system
* this/ Object/prototypes/class system

### Function scoping: IIFE
> Immediately Invoked Function Expression
````JavaScript
( function example() {

}) (); // Immediately Invoked, here's a new block of scope
````

### Expressions and statements
A single statement is often built up with lots of individual expressions.
````JavaScript
var age = 39;
age = 1 + ( age * 2 ); // expressions:
5_____4      2____1
          ____3____
_________6___________
````
### Types & coercion
* Primitive types
    * number
    * boolean
    * undefined
    * object
    * string
    * symbol
   
        _The types are associated with the values, not with the variables_
* Converting types
* Checking equality

### Coercion
The way to convert from one type to another.

Implicit coercion:
````JavaScript
console.log( string + number + string);

addStudent( Number( studentInputElement.value ));
// coercion, string to number
````

### Falsy & Truthy
Whitch values, if we try to convert them into a boolean, would become false?

Falsy | Truthy |
--- | --- |
0, -0 | "string" |
null | 11 |
NaN | { a:1 } |
false | [ 1,2 ] |
undefined | function(){...} |

A quality JS program embraces coercions, making sure the types involved in every operation are clear.

## Equality
Double equals allows coercion whn the types are different, and the triple equals siallows coercion (use it when the types are the same)
> ==

> ===

When the types are the same, double and tiple equals do exactly the same.

### Scope / closures
* Nested scope
* Closure

Scope: where to look for things

### Undefined vs undeclared
Undefined: is a variable that has been declared, but it doesn't have a value

### Function expressions

````JavaScript
//Anonymous function expression:
var sum = function() {};

// named function expression
var sum = function sum() {};
````
Named function expressions recommended, beacause they are more descriptive:

````JavaScript
// named function expression
var ids = people.map(function getId( person ) {
    return person.id;
});
````

### Block scoping with let

The let keywork will tell us to create a varaiable inside of a curly brace block:

````JavaScript
function formatStr( str ) {
    // explicit let block
    {
        let prefix, rest;
        prefix = str.slice( 0, 3);
        rest = str.slice( 3 );
        str = prefic.toUppercase() + rest;
    }

    if (/^FOO:/.test( str )) {
        return str;
    }

    return str.slice( 4 );
}

````
Principle to remind: keep things hidden whenever possible, block scoping can be a very powerful tool for helping prevent bugs/problems.

### Closure
Is when a function "remembers" the variables outside of it, even if you pass that function elsewhere.

### This / prototypes
````JavaScript
function Workshop( teacher ) {
    this.teacher = teacher;
}
Workshop.prototype.ask = function( question ) {
    console.log( this.teacher, question );
};

var deepJS = new Workshop( 'Kyle' );
var reactJS = new Workshop( 'Susy' );

deepJS.ask( "Is 'prototype' a class?");
reactJS.ask( "Isnt 'prototype' ugly?" );
