# JS Fundamentals Functional
_Abel Carrillo_

### What is functional programming?
Is a programming style, it's about breaking up your code

Assignments with Dots:

````JavaScript
var person = {};
person.name = 'Mrs. White';

var person = {
    name: 'Mrs. White'
};

````

Anything that ever uses a dot in JS is an object

### Non-primitive value
* Object
* Array
* Function
* Promise

It's recommended that you don't mutate your data structures, just copy them an then return new copy

_Arrays are Objects with some different functions_

An array is a special kind of object, the most special thing about an array is the .length property, which a property that is computed **as you add numerical indices**, and numerical indices are different than properties on an array.

### Destructuring ES6
Arrays
The target | The source |
--- | --- |
const [a,b] | = ['Mary', 'John'] |

### forEach function
_.each(array, function () {})
arr.forEach()

### Difference between arguments and parameters
Arguments are passed to the function, parameters are used within the function
````JavaScript
var name = function (name, adj) {}
                    // parameters
myArray.forEach(function(val) {console.log(val);});
                // arguments
````

### Arguments keyword
Is useful when we dont know many arguments we're gonna get.

_Functions are objects!_

## Scope
Is the area where a variable has access to some value
> let //creates blockscope

_Lexical scope_

_Callbacks_
Are functions that we pass to functions
````JavaScript
const ifElse = (condition, isTrue, isFalse) => {
    return condition ? isTrue : isFalse;
   // return condition ? isTrue() : isFalse(); to invoke the log

}

ifElse(true,
    () => { console.log(true); },
    () => { console.log(false); }
);
````

### Passing arguments
````JavaScript
const ifElse = (condition, isTrue, isFalse, ...args) => {
  console.log(args) //['HI', 'BYE', 'HOLA']
  return condition ? isTrue(...args) : isFalse(...args);
  isTrue('HI', 'BYE', 'HOLA')
};
ifElse(true, fn1, fn2, 'HI', 'BYE', 'HOLA');
````

### Reduce
Always return one value/function at the end.
It takes a list and reduces it down to one thing

It's not undefined
> !!variable


### Currying

You can create a function that can later be called multiple times with different arguments.
//research

### Composing

When you take two functions and combine them
````JavaScript
const cons = name => {
    return `I think it could be... ${name}`;
}

const ex = statement => {
    return `${statement.toUpperCase()}`;
}

const bl = _.compose(cons, ex);

bl('you');

--->'I think it could be... YOU'
````

### Advanced scope & closure

````JavaScript
const myAlert = () => {
  const x = "Help! I think I found a clue!";
  let count = 0;
  const alerter = () => {
    alert(`${x} ${++count}`);
  };

  return alerter;
};

const funcAlert = myAlert(); 
const funcAlert2 = myAlert(); 
funcAlert(); //1
funcAlert(); //2

funcAlert2(); //1
funcAlert2(); //2

// it's retaining a memory of its parent's scope, but it's different than other function's parent scope
````
A closure happens when you put two functions inside of a function and ypu can take advantage of that by returning a function that retains access to it's parent function even after it has been executed.

````JavaScript
const findSomeone = () => {

  const speak = () => {
    console.log(who);
  };

  let who = 'Why hello there, Prof Plum!';

  return speak;
};
const someoneSpeak = findSomeone();
someoneSpeak();
--> 'Why hello there, Prof Plum!';

````

_It worked because is gonna look first in its own context ( speak() ) and then it will look in the parent context._
