# Git & GitHub Notes
_Abel Carrillo_
### .git directories
> tree .git

### Print the **type** of commit file (stored in .git/objects directory)
> git cat-file -t **commit**

### Print the **content** of commit file
> git cat-file -p **commit**

_**Working area:** untracked files_

_**Staging area (cache/index):** next commit files_

_**Repo:** contains all the commits_

[Git exercise](https://github.com/nnja/advanced-git/blob/master/exercises/Exercise1-SimpleCommit.md)

---

### Remove file from staging area
> git rm --cached <file_name>

### Rename a file in the next commit
> git mv <file_name>

### Remove file from commited area
> git reset --soft HEAD^1

### Stage commits in hunks
> git add -p

### Save un-commited work (changing between branches, for example) / name stashes
````
git stash --include-untracked
git stash save "message"

````
### Tags / store aditional info
````
git tag message
git tag -a nameTag -m "message"
git show tagName

````
### Git Reuse Recorded Resolution (rerere)
````
saves how you resolved a conflict
next conflict: reuse the solution
useful for: long lived feat/branch / rebasing

git config rerere.enabled true // --global

conflict changes: git rerere diff

````

### Change to the previous branch
> git checkout -

### Delete a branch
> git checkout -D branchName

---
## Good commits are important
---

### Git commit -m
````
it's fine if the commits are brief / your code not doing a lot

for big changes, we should add a description to the commit, describing how we did what we did
````
### To see commits wich haven't been pushed upstream yet
> git cherry -v

### History of the repo
> git log / git log --since "yesterday/etc"
### Branches not merged in main branch
> git branch --no-merged master
### Un-commited work and change to a different branch
> git checkout -f branchName  //not recommended on day-to-day work but it could be useful in some cases

---
## Fixing mistakes
---

 > git checkout

 > git clean

 > git reset

 > git revert
 #### Git reset --hard HEAD~
````
moves head to the previous commit, makes a copy to staging and working area (changes can't be undone)
````

## Git rebase / amend

Amend is a quick shortcut that lets you make changes to the previus commit (ex: need to include another file to the commit)
> git commit --amend

Rebase, creates a new copy from first commit a the main branch, that way our branch is up to date with de latest commit from the main branch.
This makes resolving merge conflicts much easier

> git rebase master / our branch is up to date with master branch

Interactive rebase
>git rebase -i HEAD~2 / to go two commits back

## Merge vs rebase

## Fork
GitHub concept, is a copy of a repo' that's stored in your GitHub account, you can clone your fork to your local pc.

> git remote -v

> git remote rename origin upstream (optional)

> git remote add origin urlFork

_Note from course: There, now we should have our two remotes set up. This will allow us to push and pull changes to our personal fork, origin, while also allowing us to pull in changes from Nina's upstream version of the repo._
## Git pull vs git pull --rebase

We're gonna have a merged commit (large unsightly commit)
> git pull origin/branchName

To avoid that commit and to kepp our history cleaner, we can do --rebase flag.
Don't use it on a branch that has local merge commits
> git pull origin/branchName --rebase

## Tags
A tag needs to be pushed mannualy
> git push tagName

> git push --tags

## Recover last work

> git reflog

## Recomendations: Contributing to open source projects - PR

Before opening a PR:

* keep commit history clean and neat. Rebase if needed
* Pull in upstream changes (preferably via rebase to avoid merge commits)
* Check for a .md/.txt file in the project root (it should have guidelines for how to contribute to this project)

After opening a PR:

* Link to any open bugs that your pull request might fix
* Check back for comments from the maintainers
